## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CarFlex.git
   cd CarFlex
   ```

2. Install dependencies.

You will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
npm i
```

or

> **Note**: I reccomend using yarn

```bash
yarn
```

3. Run the application.

   ```bash
   yarn
   yarn start

   ```

4. Incase of gradle discreptencies.
   ```bash
   cd andriod
   gradlew clean
   cd ..
   yarn start --reset-cache
   ```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
